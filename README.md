CS 499 Capstone Project
</h1>
<p align="center">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This github.io website contains the capstone project for my CS 499 class at Southern New Hampshire University or SNHU. The assignment was to take one to three previous projects and enhance them in three key areas: software design, data structures and algorithms, and databases.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose three projects to complete this assignment across all three key areas. I chose a 3D scene created in OpenGL from my CS 330 Computational Graphics and Visualization course, a class sorting binary tree from my CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms course, and a Dash dashboard utilizing MongoDB from my CS 340 Client-Server Side Application. The 3D scene showcases improvements in software design and engineering as I incorporated new textures, lighting refinements, and material properties to increase graphical fidelity. The class sorter showcases algorithms and data structures enhancements as I was able to cut the search time for courses by up to 50% in certain instances using a search via course number. And the Dash dashboard showcases database improvements as it now features a customizable, local hosted database that can read your liked songs on Spotify and display their statistics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More information on my enhancements, including an initial code review, can be found at the [GitHub Pages website](https://tymort.github.io/).
